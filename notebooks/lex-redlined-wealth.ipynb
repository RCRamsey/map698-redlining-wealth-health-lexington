    "[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LZPYS0cR68) detailing how to access data for specific census tracts.  \n",
    "Can find US Census data [here](https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=2566121a73de463995ed2b2fd7ff6eb7) on the 2020 Census Bureau Demographic Data Map Viewer OR [here](data.census.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Hierarchy\n",
    "Data within the US Census bureau is organized in a hierarchy of:\n",
    "Nation-> State -> County -> Tract -> Block Group -> Block\n",
    "Where a Nation is composed of many states which are composed of many counties etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Will need to use these sites to determine the exact census tracts for data interested in. \n",
    "Will most likely need use the tract name to merge or join tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to find data\n",
    "If using **data.census.gov**  \n",
    "From here site click *advanced search* and select what filters to work through.  \n",
    "This section of the site is great for a gui that allows you to quickly visualize data attribute tables and polygons on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geography example:  \n",
    "Click advanced search-geography filter-select the hierarchy level wish to pull-state-county-within (tract)  \n",
    "To only pull data from 2020 census click on year filter and select year of interest  \n",
    "To only pull data from specific census click on surveys filter and select survey of interest  \n",
    "Click search (data tables resulting from these filters will populate)  \n",
    "Can then either download the table in csv or look in map format  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example I chose  \n",
    "advanced search-geography-block-kentucky-fayette-all blocks within fayette county  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option (great for knowing specific topic of interest but not the name of the precise survey needed to view in gui from above site.) use **census.gov/data.html**  \n",
    "From here click browse by topic, search in search bar with simple terms to find correct abbreviation of interest then return to data.census.gov and search for abbreviation of interest (example: DP04 or S1901) and refine as described above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promising Surveys  \n",
    "**DP4 Profile of Selected Housing Characteristics: 2000** Decennial Survey (since this is older data will try to utilize DP04 instead).  \n",
    "**DP04 Selected Housing Characteristics (2019: ACS American Community Survey 5 year estimates data profiles**   \n",
    "Housing units, Structure type, year built, number of rooms, year householder moved into unit (establish long term owners), vehicles, house heating, *specified owner occupying units value vs renter units*, *value owner-occupied units*, *gross rent*, *gross rent as % of household income*  \n",
