Essentially open command menu for developer tools by short cut Control+Shift+P then type in one of these commands: Dock to left, Dock to right, Dock to bottom, Undock into separate window or Restore last dock position. To toggle Restore last dock position with a keyboard shortcut, press Control+Shift+D (Linux/Windows).From there Elements, Styles, Console can each have their own menu. \n",
