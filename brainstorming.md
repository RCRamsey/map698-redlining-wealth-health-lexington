# Curious thoughts or Ideas to return to at a later date

## Health Aspect of HOLC Redlined Areas
Exploring Health as a function of environmental exposures and accessibility.
- Those in the home without health insurance (under 65yo) or with a disability (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Population density as contagious diseases can run faster through densely populated areas (data potentially from US census bureau) 
- Life expectancy (data source unknown)
- Locations of Land use, railroads, highways, byways, proximity to industry, city dumps, cemeteries, elevations, asthma rates, air particulates. 
- Heat Islands vs cooling ability, paved areas vs recreational waters and parks, and shaded areas

## Aspects of Wealth
Exploring wealth under the umbrella of the ability to accumulate generational wealth through time.
- Education location proximity of institutions or libraries through time (as higher education can lead to higher income) 
    - [Current Data](https://data-lfucg.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/67c201f27cd24921a21c69a420f6cae1_0/explore?location=38.039783%2C-84.489022%2C12.21). 
    - Historical Data (need to locate).
- Highschool education/college education (as higher education can lead to higher income) (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Computer/internet accessibility (as higher education can lead to higher income) (data potentially from US census bureau)

## Quality of Property
- NLCD Tree Land Cover data set? or tree coverage from lex
- impervious surface coverage from LEX
- distance to park (ref previous project)
- vacant lots nearby
- nearby railroad
