## Project Summary

Crampton indicated that *"maps are active and not passive"* and *"they frame the narrative"* (Crampton 2014). As such I propose a project to expolore the ripples left behind by the Home Owner's Loan Corporation Redlining Neighborhood Map *Narrative* of Lexington Kentucky and what *Active* results can be interpreted from the map's fingerprint. 

I want to design a map that displays various aspects of wealth and health of the current location of historically redlined neighborhoods because I want to find out what inequities have persisted generation to generation in order to help the user understand the impacts inherited by redlined policies in these neighborhoods through time.

As demand increases for living close to the Central Business District and it's new/improved amenities redlined neighborhoods are at risk of gentrification. It is hoped that maps such as the one I propose can inform a user so that better policies can be enacted to prevent the gentrification of these areas and increase long term resident access to benefit from these revitalized areas they have been excluded from in the past as a beginning effort toward equity.

## Potential Data Sources
All data mapped will be in comparison with the redlined neighborhoods of Lexington GeoJSON provided through [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=15/38.046/-84.534&city=lexington-ky&text=downloads) (Nelson, Winling, Marciano, Connolly et al.).

### Wealth
Exploring wealth under the umbrella of the ability to accumulate generational wealth through time.
- Education location availability of institutions or libraries through time (as higher education can lead to higher income) 
- Highschool education/college education (as higher education can lead to higher income) (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Computer/internet accessibility (as higher education can lead to higher income) (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Median household income today (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Mortgage approval rates through time (parse through HMDA home mortgage disclosure act link)
- Percent homeownership today (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Property values today (county clerks office?)

### Health
Exploring Health as a function of environmental exposures and accessibility.
- Those in the home without health insurance (under 65yo) or with a disability (data potentially from US census bureau)
- Population density as contagious diseases can run faster through densely populated areas (data potentially from US census bureau) 
- Life expectancy (data source unknown)
- Locations of Land use, railroads, highways, byways, proximity to industry, city dumps, cemeteries, elevations, asthma rates, air particulates. 
- Heat Islands vs cooling ability, paved areas vs recreational waters and parks, and shaded areas
