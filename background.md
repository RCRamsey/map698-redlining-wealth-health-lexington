The inspiration for digging into this project stemmed from An Environmental Justice & Systemic Racism Speaker Series hosted by the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-systemic-racism-speaker-series#previous) during 2021. 

Homeownership provides the means to build equity in a home as opposed to giving rent to a landlord, invest in an object whose cost typically would appreciate and protect against inflation, provides a tax deduction, and protects against increased monthly rates (30 year fixed mortgage payment) (Hotchkis 2021). Redlining practices of the 1930s have prevented populations of color for generations from accumulating wealth via home ownership.

There is no shying away from the fact that the United States has inherent systemic racism built into policies and legislation. This map project is designed as an effort to assist the user in 'knowing better' so that they can 'do better'. 

*Historical town development since 1800's to be inserted here*  
*Historical racial zoning, covenants etc to be inserted here.*    
*Info about HOLC redlining historical practices to be inserted here*   
*Info about HOLC redlining impacts studied/researched to be inserted here*  

It is my hope that users will take ownership and responsibility for the past generations of inherent racist decision/policies with a specific focus on housing in Lexington. With information in hand, informed users can use their vote to promote equitable projects and grant funding that benefit the neighborhoods and occupants continuing to be impacted by redlining practices implemented decades ago. 

Companies and organizations will continue their business as usual, aka inherent/systemic racist practices until their policies are changed. I.e. the people/public vote for the change in policies dictating legally what these companies and organizations can do. 

This is not to say, new projects or companies should infilitrate, gentrify and thereby force the relocation of the current occupants of the identified neighborhoods. 

*Suggestions or proposals for future to be inserted here*
