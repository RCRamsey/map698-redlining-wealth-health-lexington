The inspiration for digging into this project stemmed from An Environmental Justice & Systemic Racism Speaker Series hosted by the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-systemic-racism-speaker-series#previous) during 2021. 

There is no shying away from the fact that the United States has inherent systemic racism built into policies and legislation. This map project is designed as an effort to assit the user in 'knowing better' so that they can 'do better'. 

Info about HOLC redlining historical practices here.
Legacy land use practice
Prevented populations living in these redlined areas from acquiring and accumulating generational wealth. 
Historical racial zoning.

It is my hope that users will take ownership and responsibility for the past generations of inherent racist decision/policies with a specific focus on housing in Lexington. With information in hand, informed users can use their vote to promote equitable projects that benefit the neighborhoods and occumpants continuing to be impacted by redlining practices implemented decades ago. 

Companies and organizations will continue their business as usual, aka inherent/systemic racist practices until their policies are changed. I.e. the people/public vote for the change in policies dictating what these companies and organizations can do legally. 

This is not to say, new projects or companies should infilitrate, gentrify and thereby force the relocation of the current occupants of the identified neighborhoods.
